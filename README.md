# Hyperparameter-Tuning
The assignment evaluates the performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for short-term traffic speed prediction using the METR-LA dataset. The focus is on predicting the next 5-minute interval for sensor ID 773869. The model is implemented in PyTorch with a single hidden layer, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as an activation function, trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, and optimized using the Adam optimizer. Each configuration is trained over 50 epochs using an 80:20 chronological train- validation split and evaluated across three independent runs.
The goal is to determine how learning rate, batch size, and the number of hidden nodes affect the model performance, model stability, training time, and convergence of training and validation loss.
